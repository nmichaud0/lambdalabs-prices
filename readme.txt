# VRAM Analysis on Lambda Labs

## Why More VRAM Doesn't Mean Better Performance

More VRAM allows for larger models and datasets, but it doesn't inherently improve computational power or processing speed. Performance depends on factors such as GPU architecture, CUDA cores, memory bandwidth, and workload type. More VRAM is beneficial for specific tasks but doesn't guarantee overall better performance.
